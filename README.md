# Motivation
A simple, easy to understand document that aims to describe the problem of
phishing, how using two-factor authentication helps defeat it, and how physical
security keys make Phishing impossible.

It is targeted towards non-technical audience.

Pull requests are welcome and encouraged.

# Terms
## Phishing
Phishing is the attempt to obtain sensitive information such as usernames,
passwords, and credit card details (and, indirectly, money), often for malicious
reasons, by disguising as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication.

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Two-factor authentication (also known as 2FA) is a method of confirming a user's
claimed identity by utilizing a combination of two different components.

## Universal 2nd Factor (U2F)
Universal 2nd Factor (also known as U2F) is an open authentication standard that
strengthens and simplifies 2FA.

## Physical Security Keys
